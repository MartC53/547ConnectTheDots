# Elevator Pitch

The google play store has about 3.5 million apps available for download, so there is likely an app for that, but not one of those apps converts your
phone into a $20,000 laboratory grade diagnostic device that can diagnose infections like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. We are connect the dots, a group focused
on integrating single temperature DNA amplification technologies, phone camera and flash image acquisition, and on machine learning image analysis for
edge computing to bring PCR like diagnostic assays to your home or around the globe. Our integrated technologies combine the power of quantitative and
sensitive PCR assays with the rapid and robust binary pregnancy style tests that we have all become accustomed to over the last year for a single rapid
quantitative diagnostic test. This allows our test to not only inform on binary infected non infected status but also track disease and infectivity
progression. If you are interested in learning more please come see team, connecting the dots, at our poster.
