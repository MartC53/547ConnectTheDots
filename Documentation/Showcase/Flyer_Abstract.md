# Flyer Abstract

When diagnosing infectious diseases like HIV and SARS-CoV-2 quantitative tests are the gold standard; these tests have the highest diagnostic power
for clinical decision making and inform on viral progression or suppression. However, these tests often have a slow turnaround time, are expensive,
and are fragile which limit their application in resource poor settings. A recent publication from the Posner Research Group has demonstrated a novel
approach for a distributable edge computing quantitative test that is faster, cheaper, and more robust. This approach leverages real time image
collection, reaction site formation, and reaction site analysis. Here we apply machine learning on these images to extend the dynamic range of the
published assay using phone-based image acquisition, processing, and analysis. Through our decision tree model we are able to extend the quantifiable
dynamic range of the published assay by two orders of magnitude.
